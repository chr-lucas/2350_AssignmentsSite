                        I got stuck in the weeds a number of times: Elements

                        and selecting a color scheme that with sufficient
                        contrast. All things considered, I'm pleased with
                        the final outcome.</q>

                    <q>It's obviously harder to come up with original design
                        than it is to follow a step-by-step assignment, but the
                        task of revisiting a "completed" page and rethinking
                        the design elements was pretty tricky! In the end, I had
                        many of the needed elements already, so it was a matter
                        of finding little ways to get some extra style layered
                        in to the original concept.</q>

                    <q>I enjoyed this assignment quite a bit. The process of

                        very methodical, but the styling was much more free-form
                        and creative. A great representation of the HTML/CSS
                        relationship.</q>

                        are never apparent as you scroll through your day, but

                    <q>This assignment seemed very daunting at first. The
                        assignment page gives directions, sure, but the solution
                        the gets you there is almost entirely freeform. As I
                        went along, I got into it. Code that turned out to be a
                        deadend just meant some quick debugging. Code that worked
                        as intended was like a small private celebration. It felt
                        very good to make this!
