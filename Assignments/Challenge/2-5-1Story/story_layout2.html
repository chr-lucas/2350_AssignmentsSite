        <h3>Wait...You Eat Garbage!?</h3>
        <p>Yes, and proudly. The Garbage Plate is the signature dish
            of Rochester, NY, and despite its offputting name, it is delicious!
            If you've ever been to a summer picnic and piled your plate high
            with all the great food on offer, you may have eaten one without
            even knowing it. At its most basic, a Garbage Plate is a big serving
            each of homefries and macaroni salad with a hamburger or hot dog
            laid on top.</p>

        <h3>Build A Foundation With Fries</h3>
        <p>To get things started, half of the dish is set up with a heaping
            helping of home fries. These little potato nuggets, fried up crispy,
            act as the unifying agent of a proper Plate. The salty but otherwise
            unintrusive fries will complement each bite without overtaking any
            of the other flavors.</p>

        <h3>Put Some Mac In Your Snack</h3>
        <p>Sharing the foundational levels, a mayo based macaroni salad fills up
            the other half of the bottom of the dish. This creamy side will add
            a little richness and a great contrast of hot vs cold once we dig
            in. Importantly, this is a more East Coast macaroni salad
            preperation, with a much less vinegary flavor profile and very few
            added veggies.</p>

        <h3>The Main Event: Pick Your Meat</h3>
        <p>The biggest personalization point of a Plate is the main protein that
            will sit atop your carbs like a regent upon a throne. The most
            common choices are two cheeseburger patties or two hot dogs.
            No buns, just the meat. To mix things up, many will get a combo, and
            do one of each.</p>

        <h3>Dress (Your Plate) For Success</h3>
        <p>Lastly, the condements. Since your Plate is, essentially, just a huge deconstructed picnic, you can
            treat it almost the same as if you were dressing up a burger.
            Ketchup, mustard, relish, and diced onion are all traditional
            fixins for Garbage Plates. And then, the secret ingredient.
            Rochester's "Meat Hot", a slightly spicy ground beef hotsauce. Get a
            big laddel spooned over the top, and let it add just the right
            amount of kick to every bite.</p>
